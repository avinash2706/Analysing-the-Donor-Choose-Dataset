The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. 

- Performed data manipulations.
- Plotted data visualizations like t-sne, stackedplot etc to get to know better about features.
- Used BOW, TF-IDF, AvgW2V, TF-IDF W2V for Text processing and compared the results.
- Implemented different Machine Learning models like RandomForest, XGBoost, LinearSVC with Stochastic gradient descent etc.
- Used GridSearchCV for Hyperparameters and ROC-AUC for evaluating models.
