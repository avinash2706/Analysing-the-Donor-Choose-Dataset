- Performed data manipulations.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and plotted data visualizations like t-sne, stackedplot etc to get to know better about features.
- Used BOW, TF-IDF, AvgW2V, TF-IDF W2V for Text processing and compared the results.
- Implemented different Machine Learning models like RandomForest, XGBoost, LinearSVC with Stochastic gradient descent etc.
- Used GridSearchCV for Hyperparameters and ROC-AUC for evaluating models.
